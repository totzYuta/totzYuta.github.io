    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>New Mac</h2>

<p>I love CUI, commands, the world of characters. And I got a new pc of OS X because of an internship of Cyber Agent I joined this summer. So I set up comfortable environment for nice CUI life by iTerm and zsh.</p>

<h2>iTerm</h2>

<h3>Install</h3>

<p>First, I installed iTerm from the URL below.</p>

<p><a href="http://iterm2.com/index.html">http://iterm2.com/index.html</a></p>

<p>That is nicer than default terminal of OS X, I guess. That is very customizable.</p>

<h3>Theme Color</h3>

<p>iTerm has a lot of color themes. You can access the repository fro the URL below.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes">https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes</a></p>

<p>iTerm2-Color-Shemes is very cool and easy tool. The README.md is really easy to understand and follow the introduction. I could install that easily.</p>

<p>I chose Espresso. That theme is not bright so I prefer.</p>

<h2>zsh</h2>

<p>zsh is a kind of shell. The default shell of OS X is bash. bash is also great (the author looks so strong anyway..lol) but zsh is nice for geeks who want to customize a shell easily and well.</p>

<p>First installed Homebrew to install other programs.</p>

<p><a href="http://brew.sh/">http://brew.sh/</a></p>

<p><code>
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
</code></p>

<p>And installed zsh by brew command.</p>

<p><code>
$ brew install zsh
</code></p>

<p>You can change the default shell if you want.</p>

<p><code>
$ chsh -s /usr/local/bin/zsh
</code></p>

<p>And I really want to reccomend oh-my-zsh. That is really easy tool to set many plugins and cool theme for zsh.</p>

<p>You can clone the repository and set up by the commands below.</p>

<p><code>
% git clone git://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh.git ~/.oh-my-zsh
% cp ~/.oh-my-zsh/templates/zshrc.zsh-template ~/.zshrc
</code></p>

<p>Set the theme by editing ~/.zshrc file. I chose a theme, avit.</p>

<p><code>
export ZSH_THEME="robbyrussell"
</code></p>

<p>All themes are in ~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/ and also check here: <a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Themes">https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Themes</a></p>

<h2>CUI</h2>

<p>That is all! CUI is really useful and fun. Let&rsquo;s enjoy it.</p>
