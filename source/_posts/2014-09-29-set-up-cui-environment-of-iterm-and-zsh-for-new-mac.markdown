## New Mac

I love CUI, commands, the world of characters. And I got a new pc of OS X because of an internship of Cyber Agent I joined this summer. So I set up comfortable environment for nice CUI life by iTerm and zsh.

## iTerm

### Install

First, I installed iTerm from the URL below.

http://iterm2.com/index.html

That is nicer than default terminal of OS X, I guess. That is very customizable.

### Theme Color

iTerm has a lot of color themes. You can access the repository fro the URL below.

https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes

iTerm2-Color-Shemes is very cool and easy tool. The README.md is really easy to understand and follow the introduction. I could install that easily.


I chose Espresso. That theme is not bright so I prefer.


## zsh

zsh is a kind of shell. The default shell of OS X is bash. bash is also great (the author looks so strong anyway..lol) but zsh is nice for geeks who want to customize a shell easily and well.

First installed Homebrew to install other programs.

http://brew.sh/

```
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

And installed zsh by brew command. 

```
$ brew install zsh
```

You can change the default shell if you want.

```
$ chsh -s /usr/local/bin/zsh
```

And I really want to reccomend oh-my-zsh. That is really easy tool to set many plugins and cool theme for zsh.

You can clone the repository and set up by the commands below.

```
% git clone git://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh.git ~/.oh-my-zsh
% cp ~/.oh-my-zsh/templates/zshrc.zsh-template ~/.zshrc
```

Set the theme by editing ~/.zshrc file. I chose a theme, avit.

```
export ZSH_THEME="robbyrussell"
```

All themes are in ~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/ and also check here: https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Themes

## CUI

That is all! CUI is really useful and fun. Let's enjoy it.
